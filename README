This tiny little extension adds a few features to the f7u12 subreddit on reddit.com.
Right now, in its first iteration, it both shows the alt-text of the rage faces in the comments (e.g. the attached screen shots),
and gives you a button to press, "Pick a face!", that gives you a menu of faces to choose between and use in your comments.
After clicking, the code for using that particular face is automatically added to your comment.

This was thrown together in under an hour, and thusly looks very bad and probably has a few bugs.
If you like this extension and have ideas/found any bugs, please contact me!
I'll be adding faces as soon as they are added by moderators.

PS: This was the first thing I ever wrote in JS and badly commented because I wrote it in a hurry.
Added here because someone on reddit wanted the source :)
